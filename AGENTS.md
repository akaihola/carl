# Agent Instructions for Carl Project

## Browser Support & Modern Technologies

- **Target modern browsers only**: Firefox 145+, Chromium 143+ (November 2025 and later)
- Leverage cutting-edge CSS and browser APIs without legacy support concerns
- No need for polyfills or backward compatibility workarounds

## CSS-First Development

- Prioritize CSS for styling, layout, animations, and interactive states
- Use CSS Grid, Flexbox, CSS custom properties, and modern CSS features
- Implement hover states, focus states, and transitions purely in CSS
- Leverage CSS container queries, subgrid, and cascade layers where appropriate

## JavaScript Approach

- Write concise, elegant, maintainable pure JavaScript
- Minimize JavaScript complexity—if CSS can do it, prefer CSS
- Use modern JavaScript (ES2024+): async/await, destructuring, template literals, etc.
- Keep scripts focused on logic and state management, not presentation
- Prefer native browser APIs over frameworks when appropriate

## Code Quality

- Clear, self-documenting code without unnecessary comments
- Prefer semantic HTML and semantic element use
- Take advantage of modern browser APIs: Web Components, Fetch API, LocalStorage, etc.
- Write performant, accessible code without legacy constraints
